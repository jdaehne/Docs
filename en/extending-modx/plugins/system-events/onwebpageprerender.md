## Event: OnWebPagePrerender

Fired after a Resource is parsed, but before it is rendered.

Content Type headers have not yet been sent, nor has the output been flushed.

-   Service: 5 - Template Service Events
-   Group: None

## Event Parameters

None.

## Example

**Description:** Filter words from a document before it's displayed on the web
**System Events:** OnWebPagePrerender

```php
$words = array("snippet", "template"); // words to filter
$output = &$modx->resource->_output; // get a reference to the output
$output = str_replace($words,"<b>[filtered]</b>",$output);
```

Be careful if your OnWebPagePrerender plugin is a static element and it includes or requires files using _relative paths_. The plugin code executes from its cached file, e.g. `core/cache/includes/elements/modplugin/7.include.cache.php`, not from the original static element file. See [Bug 11129](https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues/11129)

## Example

Such a plugin will replace the words on pages:

```php
<?php
$eventName = $modx->event->name;
switch($eventName) {
    case 'OnWebPagePrerender': 
        // words to be replaced
        $words = array("Product", "Price");
        // get access to the page content
        $output = &$modx->resource->_output;
        // we replace words
        $output = str_replace($words,"changed",$output); 
        break;
}
```
